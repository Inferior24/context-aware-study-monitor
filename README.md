# Autonomous RAG Monitoring System

The **Autonomous RAG Monitoring System** is a context-aware architecture designed to intelligently manage, monitor, and analyze the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. It integrates vector-based retrieval, RESTful orchestration, and real-time observability through a unified system built with **FastAPI**, **FAISS**, **Elasticsearch**, **Kibana**, and **Prometheus**.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of how modern AI pipelines can achieve autonomy, scalability, and transparency using distributed monitoring and feedback-driven optimization.

---

## System Overview

The system is divided into two primary functional modules — **RAG Ingestion** and **RAG Query**, each managed as independent yet interconnected FastAPI microservices. These services are supported by a monitoring and analytics stack that ensures end-to-end visibility of data flow, query performance, and retrieval accuracy.

The architecture aims to transform static retrieval pipelines into self-observing systems that continuously evaluate and improve themselves using metric-based insights and elastic observability.

---

## Conceptual Workflow

The workflow of the Autonomous RAG Monitoring System can be divided into four major layers: **Ingestion**, **Retrieval**, **Monitoring**, and **Visualization**.

### 1. Ingestion Layer

The **RAG Ingestion Service** is responsible for processing raw text documents and preparing them for semantic retrieval.  
Its tasks include:
- Text preprocessing and chunking  
- Vectorization of document chunks using language model embeddings  
- Indexing and storage of vectors in a **FAISS** index for similarity search  
- Storing associated metadata (title, source, timestamp) for traceability  
- Logging ingestion events and operational metrics to Elasticsearch and Prometheus

This layer ensures that all data entering the system is structured, searchable, and observable from the moment it’s ingested.

---

### 2. Retrieval Layer

The **RAG Query Service** acts as the intelligent interface between the user and the retrieval engine.  
When a query request is received, the service:
- Accepts the user’s input query via a REST API endpoint  
- Embeds the query into a vector representation  
- Performs nearest-neighbor search using **FAISS** to retrieve top-k semantically relevant chunks  
- Retrieves metadata and context from the FAISS index  
- Passes results to a language model (or response synthesis layer) for contextually aware answer generation  
- Logs latency, hit-rate, and retrieval metrics for further analysis

By coupling FAISS with FastAPI, the query flow remains asynchronous, low-latency, and easily scalable.

---

### 3. Monitoring Layer

To ensure operational transparency and system reliability, a comprehensive monitoring layer is built using **Prometheus** and **Elasticsearch**.

- **Prometheus** collects quantitative system metrics such as:
  - API latency, response times, and error rates  
  - Number of retrieval calls per second  
  - Query cache hits and misses  
  - Document ingestion rate  
  - Resource utilization metrics  

  Each FastAPI endpoint exposes these metrics at a `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format.

- **Elasticsearch** stores structured logs and ingestion metadata for qualitative analysis and historical trend evaluation.  
  This enables queries such as:
  - "Which document sources produce the most retrieval hits?"  
  - "What query categories trigger slow responses?"  

Together, these monitoring tools create a feedback loop that transforms the RAG pipeline from a static retrieval system into an adaptive intelligence infrastructure.

---

### 4. Visualization Layer

The visualization layer is powered by **Kibana**, providing real-time dashboards for both operational and analytical insights.

Predefined visualizations display:
- Query throughput and latency distribution  
- Ingestion activity over time  
- FAISS retrieval accuracy and performance  
- Aggregated metrics from Prometheus (response times, success ratios, and load averages)  
- Error and exception tracking across ingestion and query services  

By correlating system logs with performance data, developers can pinpoint inefficiencies and bottlenecks in real time.

## System Architecture

The architecture can be logically visualized as a fully integrated data flow:

## Data Flow Description

1. **Document Entry** – The ingestion module receives structured or unstructured data and generates embeddings stored in a FAISS index.  
2. **Vector Index Construction** – Each data segment is encoded as a vector and indexed for efficient retrieval.  
3. **Query Handling** – Incoming user queries are converted to vectors and matched against the FAISS index to retrieve semantically relevant content.  
4. **Contextual Response Formation** – Retrieved context is merged with metadata and optionally processed through a language model to produce final responses.  
5. **Metric Emission** – All API requests, retrieval timings, and ingestion events emit metrics to Prometheus and logs to Elasticsearch.  
6. **Dashboard Visualization** – Kibana dashboards present live system health, retrieval accuracy, latency distribution, and ingestion statistics.
