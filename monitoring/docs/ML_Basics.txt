                        MACHINE LEARNING BASICS
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems
to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Instead
of following pre-written rules, ML algorithms identify patterns in data and make
predictions or decisions based on those patterns.

HISTORY & EVOLUTION:
================================================================================

ORIGINS & TIMELINE:
- 1950s: The term "Machine Learning" was coined by Arthur Samuel at IBM
- 1956: Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence marked
  the birth of AI as a field, with ML as a core component
- 1966-1974: First "AI Winter" - period of reduced funding and interest
- 1980s: Expert systems and knowledge-based systems gained popularity
- 1987-1993: Second "AI Winter" - disillusionment with early AI promises
- 1997: IBM's Deep Blue defeats Garry Kasparov in chess
- 2006: Geoffrey Hinton's breakthrough in deep learning with neural networks
- 2011: IBM's Watson wins Jeopardy! against human champions
- 2012: AlexNet wins ImageNet competition, sparking deep learning revolution
- 2016: AlphaGo defeats Lee Sedol in Go - major milestone in AI capability

  practical AI applications explosion

KEY PIONEERS:
- Arthur Samuel (1901-1990): Father of Machine Learning
- Geoffrey Hinton: Pioneer in deep learning and neural networks
- Yann LeCun: Developer of convolutional neural networks

HOW ML CAME TO VISION:
Early researchers realized that computers could learn statistical patterns from
data rather than relying on hand-crafted rules. The exponential growth in
computing power (Moore's Law), availability of massive datasets (Big Data era),
and algorithmic improvements (deep learning) made practical ML applications
possible. The democratization of ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
and cloud computing enabled broader adoption across industries.
