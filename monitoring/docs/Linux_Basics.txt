                          LINUX BASICS GUIDE
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
Linux is a free, open-source operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds
that manages hardware resources and allows software applications to run. It's the
core component that powers servers, desktops, mobile devices, embedded systems,
and supercomputers worldwide. Linux enables you to directly control computer
hardware through command-line interfaces and graphical environments.

HOW LINUX CAME TO VISION:
In 1991, computing was expensive with proprietary systems controlling the
market. Linus Torvalds wanted to learn operating system design using Minix,
a small Unix clone. He built a terminal emulator, then a file system, eventually
creating a complete kernel. The combination of GPL licensing (ensuring freedom)
and open-source development model enabled global collaboration. As hardware
became cheaper and companies faced licensing costs, Linux offered a compelling
free alternative. The internet accelerated Linux adoption through collaborative
development and knowledge sharing. Today, Linux is the most widely deployed
operating system globally.

open-source nature, combined with powerful tools and community support, makes
it indispensable for modern programmers and system administrators.

Understanding Linux fundamentals is crucial for any developer today. Whether
developing web applications, managing cloud infrastructure, or building embedded
systems, Linux expertise is increasingly essential.

The Linux ecosystem continues evolving with containerization, cloud-native
architectures, and IoT applications. This is an excellent time to build your
